    "Another important statistic for assessing risk is the correlation between the returns of two assets. Correlation is a measure of how closely two datasets are associated with each other. It is often represented by the correlation coefficient, which is a value that ranges between -1 and 1. This indicates whether there is a positive correlation, negative correlation, or no correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In finance, two assets from the same industry generally have a positive correlation, as they are likely affected by similar external conditions. So for example, automobile stocks may be positively correlated with each other while oil stocks may be negatively correlated with automobile stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a portfolio, it is generally a good idea to include assets that are not correlated with each other. If assets are independent of one another, then there is a lower risk of the financial loss that can occur when assets in a portfolio are correlated. This allows for greater diversification and balances out the overall risk and return of the portfolio.\n",
